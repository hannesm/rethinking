Opinions may differ, but we think that the world of computers is in a dire
situation right now.  People are focussing their innovative minds on the next
new app, the next layer, the next container.  And then there are the good old
updates such as the next Apple event, the next Google IO, new phone operating
system or hardware, big corporation releasing next big thing.  Frontend
developers are kept busy learning the next JavaScript framework instead of
focusing on applying the basics in practice, on refactoring, and on the user.
Self-acclaimed thought leaders are trying to find unicorns, funding, and copy
each others ideas.

We think there are more interesting problems to solve, and to get ready for
them, we want to rethink what we already have.

How does a computer work?  Is it really a new idea if I move an existing idea
across an abstraction layer?  What is an abstraction?  How does caching work?
Why are containers cool?  What makes a buzzword and what makes a good concept?
What can we learn from the 70s?  Does computer science actually exist?  Is each
layer of a computer system destined to be another fallen empire and extinct
civilisation?

We are curious to explore questions like these, and build a solid foundation of
knowledge around computers that is accessible for everyone.

Why are we doing this?  First of all, we find this super exciting.  And we think
it is time to do this, and the time is now.  If no one spends the time to
reflect where we are steering towards, we will end up in an attention grabbing
inhuman algorithm-dominated world.  It's us who make the decisions, because it
is our work.  But we need time, space, and knowledge to discuss this future.

And we need you!  This is a big idea, and we need everyone with their questions,
answers, knowledge, and feedback.  We promise to collect and curate as much
information as we can and make it readable for everyone.  We hope to be a good
resource of knowledge and we also hope to provide an independent platform for
discussion without any dependency on any corporation or on your profile as it is
known in the Internet.  Believe in something, stand for something, fall for
nothing.
